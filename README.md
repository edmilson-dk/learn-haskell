# Learn Haskell

![Haskell](https://github.com/edmilson-dk/learn-haskell/blob/main/.github/haskell.png)

My trajectory in haskell studies, a little bit every day.

## Motivation

My central reason for studying haskell, is the possibility to understand more deeply how the functional programming ecosystem works and to get a little out of the bubble of the object-oriented world, besides the pleasure of obtaining more knowledge.
